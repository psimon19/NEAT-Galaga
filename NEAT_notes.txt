SELECTION
1) Each genome plays galaga
2) Each genome is assigned a fitness score based on performance
3) Cull lowest scoring half of the genomes
4) Top half of the genomes are ranked in order of fitness
5) Best genome is flagged

REPLICATION
 -- Repopulate next generation with genomes --
6) Copy champion of previous generation
7) Clone (X% of genomes for next generation)
	a) Use distribution to choose a survivor, randomly
8) Crossover (Y% of genomes for next generation)
	a) Choose two random genomes to mate using same sampling technique
	b) Categories for crossing over genes in the genomes
		i) Matching (same innovation number)
		ii) Disjoint (One parent genes falls within innovation range of another parent
		iii) Excess (Gene outside the innovation range of the other parent)

MUTATION (Loop through all genomes)
9) Weight mutations
	a) Iterate through every gene for a given genome
		i) P(Change gene weight) = .80
			- P(Adjust current weight) = .9
			- P(New random weight) = .1
	b) Enable/disable a gene
10) Structural mutations
	a) P(adding gene between neurons) = .05
	b) P(adding node) = .03

SPECIATION
11) Check if newly mutated genome is no longer compatible with current species
	a) Reassign or create new species
12) Population control
	a) Distribute genome population across species
13) Culling species
	a) Stagnation: Cannot converge after n generations
	b) Extinction: Population is too low to survive
